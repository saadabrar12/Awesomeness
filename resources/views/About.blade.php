		<h2> SUPPORT YOUTH'S VOICE</h2>
		<p>
			Even a smile is Charity. Youth's Voice does not wait to receive funds before it responds to urgent needs in the field, and counts on the goodwill of its contributors to provide the funds as quickly as possible. We are funded by contributions from the general public whom we approach with the aid of our volunteers. Corporate companies and adminstration bodies of Bangladesh provide a helping hand as well. All funding is voluntary. Your donation will help us meet the most important needs of the underprivileged ones. You have an opportunity to specify which program you want to support when making a donation; however, we can accept donations for a specific school, village, project, group of individuals or a specific area in a country. To ensure that donors' contributions are put to the best possible use we invite them whole-heartedly to all our events.
